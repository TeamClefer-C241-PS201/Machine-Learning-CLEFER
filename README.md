## Bangkit Capstone Project 2024
Bangkit Capstone Team ID : C241-PS201 <br>
Here is our repository for Bangkit 2024 Capstone project - Machine Learning

## Datasets
The project utilizes the following datasets for training the machine learning models:
* [Corn Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/buffyhridoy/corn-disease)

## About Model
The model is created using Tensorflow and Keras Library then using CNN to create a neural network after that the model will be trained and the training results will be predicted. The trained model is a model regarding corn disease prediction. The corn disease model uses image_size (128,128). Then this model achieves 91% accuracy. Then after the model is successfully trained, the model will be tested. After that the model will be saved and an API will be created so that it can be deployed and can be used on Mobile.
